				%h2 How's the pisser?

				%p
					This is a question we ask ourselves and our friends too often. Well now, <strong>ask the internet</strong> how the pisser is. Do it, I dare you.

				%p 
					Connect to Foursquare to find out and tell your friends

				%a{:href => "/foursquare"}
					%img{:src => "/images/foursquare-connect-blue.png"}
			- else
				%h2 
					#{current_user.first_name} #{current_user.last_name}, how's the pisser today?
					%small
						%a{:href => "/goodbye"} Goodbye

				%p
					So this part is under construction yet. But do not fear! This will be done soon enough. Stay tuned and keep pissing.
